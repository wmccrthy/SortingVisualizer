# SortingVisualizer
*IN PROGRESS* Very primitive pygame program for visualizing sorting algorithms.  
At the moment program only supports selectionSort, bubbleSort and mergeSort though I plan to add more algorithms soon. UI is very basic and indicates controls. If you begin a sort, please allow it to finish before further input.
